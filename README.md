# JS Game Starter

## ðŸš€ Setup
\`\`\`bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
\`\`\`

When ready for local development:
\`\`\`bash
npm install
npm run dev
\`\`\`

`./setup.sh` automatically installs dependencies. If the default registry is
blocked, it falls back to a mirror and, if needed, downloads a cached archive
from GitHub so you don't have to do anything manually.

 After running `npm run build`, commit and push the generated `docs` folder on the `main` branch to update the live site.
